            The voices in my head
Keep on telling me to pray
'Cause I'm spinning like a
Carousel circling the drain

Hit the bottom of the bottle
I don't wanna feel the pain
But that is all I got for now
I don’t wanna talk about it

The voices in my head
Keep on begging me to stay
If I pull the trigger now
Then the demons go away

And I know my time is coming
So there ain’t no time to waste
So that is all I got for now
I don’t wanna talk about it

The voices in my head
Keep telling me to choose a side
Heaven or hell like it’s do or die
I'm a sad, boy, you know better
Please don’t make this last forever

The voices in my head
Keep telling me I'm not okay
'Cause it’s feeling like a hurricane in my brain
Dark clouds, hard times, bad weather
Please don’t make this last forever

(I)
The voices in my head
Keep telling me I'm gonna (die)
And I don’t wanna talk
About the drama, I'm trauma (tized)

They're telling me I'm fine
But we both know that’s a fucking (lie)
I'm losing my mind but
I don’t wanna talk about it

The voices in my head
Keep giving me the worst advice
Kamikaze crash like a suicide
I'm a lost boy, you know better
Please don’t make this last forever

The voices in my head
Keep telling me I'm insane
And maybe I'm a little bit
That won’t change
Dark clouds, hard times, bad weather
Please don’t make this last forever

(I)
The voices in my head
Keep telling me I'm gonna (die)
And I don’t wanna talk
About the drama, I'm trauma (tized)

They're telling me I'm fine
But we both know that’s a fucking (lie)
I'm losing my mind but
I don’t wanna talk about it

The voices in my head
Keep telling me I'm cursed
I'm paranoid, I don’t wanna make it any worse
We’re all gonna die but first things first
I'ma take the world with me
When they put me in the dirt

The voices in my head
Keep telling me I'm cursed
I'm paranoid, I don’t wanna make it any worse
We’re all gonna die but first things first
I'ma take the world with me
When they put me in the dirt (move)

The voices in my head
Keep telling me I'm cursed
I'm paranoid, I don’t wanna make it any worse
We’re all gonna die but first things first
I'ma take the world with me
When they put me in the dirt

(I)
The voices in my head
Keep telling me I'm gonna (die)
And I don’t wanna talk
About the drama, I'm trauma (tized)

They're telling me I'm fine
But we both know that’s a fucking (lie)
I'm losing my mind but
I don’t wanna talk about it

The voices in my head
Keep on telling me to pray
'Cause I'm spinning like a
Carousel circling the drain

Hit the bottom of the bottle
I don't wanna feel the pain but
I'm losing my mind but
I don’t wanna talk about it
